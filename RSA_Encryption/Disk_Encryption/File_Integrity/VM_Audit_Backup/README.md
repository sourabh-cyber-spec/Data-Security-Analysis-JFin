# VM Audit & Backup

This folder contains the work related to **auditing security settings** in a Windows VM and setting up **backup strategies** for the Data Security Analysis (JFin Payments) project.

### What I did
- Checked **Local Security Policies** in Windows VM:
  - Password Policy
  - Account Lockout Policy
  - Audit Policy
  - Security Options
- Took snapshots/backups of the VM to ensure data availability.

### Why this is important
- **Auditing** ensures that the VM is compliant with best security practices.  
- **Backups** guarantee availability of data and fast recovery in case of failure or cyber incidents.

### Files & Screenshots (to be added later)
- Screenshots of Local Security Policy settings.
- Screenshot of VM backup/snapshot creation.
