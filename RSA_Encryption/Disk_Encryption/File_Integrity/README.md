# File Integrity Verification 

This folder contains the work related to verifying file integrity using cryptographic hashing in the **Data Security Analysis (JFin Payments)** project.

### What I did
- Downloaded a DLL file and generated its **SHA256 hash** using Kali Linux.
- Compared the generated hash with the official hash.
- Verified that the file was not tampered with (hashes matched).

### Why this is important
File integrity ensures that downloaded files or critical system files have not been modified by attackers.  
It protects against **supply chain attacks** and unauthorized changes.

### Files & Screenshots (to be added later)
- Screenshot of `sha256sum` output in Kali Linux.
- Notes on hash comparison.
