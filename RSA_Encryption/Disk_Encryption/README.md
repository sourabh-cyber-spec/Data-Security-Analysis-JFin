# Disk Encryption 

This folder contains the work related to disk encryption in the **Data Security Analysis (JFin Payments)** project.

### What I did
- Implemented **BitLocker** on Windows to encrypt the virtual disk.
- Used a recovery key to ensure secure access.
- Verified encryption progress on the VM.

### Why this is important
Disk encryption protects **data at rest** (stored data) from unauthorized access in case of theft or loss.

### Files & Screenshots (to be added later)
- Screenshot of BitLocker encryption in progress.
- Notes on encryption process.
